The Web Application Security Testing Lab is a comprehensive, hands-on cybersecurity environment designed to simulate real-world attack and defense scenarios for web applications.
This project integrates offensive security testing, threat analysis, and defensive remediation in a containerized, reproducible architecture built with Kali Linux, Docker, and Proxmox.

It demonstrates end-to-end web penetration testing workflows aligned with the OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG), focusing on vulnerability discovery, CVSS scoring, and secure patch verification.

üîç Key Features
	‚Ä¢	OWASP-Compliant Testing Framework ‚Äì Coverage across injection flaws, broken authentication, XSS, security misconfigurations, and more.
	‚Ä¢	Multi-Tool Integration ‚Äì Combines Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, Nmap, SQLMap, and Splunk for hybrid automated/manual testing pipelines.
	‚Ä¢	Realistic Vulnerable Targets ‚Äì Includes DVWA, OWASP Juice Shop, and custom PHP applications hosted on isolated Docker containers.
	‚Ä¢	CVSS v3.1 Risk Assessment ‚Äì Quantitative scoring of vulnerabilities with mapped severity and business impact.
	‚Ä¢	Remediation Validation ‚Äì Secure code reviews and retesting after implementing fixes such as parameterized queries, CSP headers, and input sanitization.
	‚Ä¢	Evidence Repository ‚Äì Structured proof-of-concept (PoC) screenshots, logs, and reports demonstrating exploit execution and verification.
	‚Ä¢	Scalable Cloud-Lab Architecture ‚Äì Deployable in Proxmox, VirtualBox, or AWS EC2 environments for academic or professional demonstrations.
